# Revenge of the Shaman's Son

This is a game made in Unity where you must navigate an perilous dungeon to recover the lost plushie of the Shaman's son!

If you wish to make it out alive, you must learn to operate a horrendously detailed Colt Single Action Army revolver, and craft your own ammunition to match the firepower of the enemy.
